Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I is a type of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Surgical Resection is a form of Local Therapy.
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR/SBRT) is a form of Local Therapy.
Surgical Resection is the initial treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I.
Surgical Resection is recommended for patients who are Medically Operable.
Lobectomy is the preferred surgical approach for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I.
Segmentectomy or Wedge Resection is an alternative surgical approach for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I.
Segmentectomy or Wedge Resection is considered for patients with Small tumors or compromised lung function.
Surgical Resection aims to achieve Local Control.
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR/SBRT) is the initial treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I.
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR/SBRT) is recommended for patients who are Medically Inoperable.
SABR aims to achieve Local Control.
Adjuvant Chemotherapy may be considered after Surgical Resection.
Consideration for Adjuvant Chemotherapy depends on High-risk features (e.g., larger tumor size).
Diagnosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer requires a Biopsy.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer requires testing for Molecular Markers (e.g., EGFR, ALK, PD-L1).
Molecular Markers guide targeted therapy selection for Advanced NSCLC (and sometimes adjuvant).
Local Control is a primary goal of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I Treatment.
Multidisciplinary Evaluation is recommended for All Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.
